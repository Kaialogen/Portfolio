      Hey, I'm Kai, a dedicated Cyber Security undergrad and full-stack developer who thrives on building and shipping
      solutions that truly matter. I work primarily with React.js, JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript to craft robust
      applications on both the frontend and backend.
      <br />
      <br />I specialise in crafting secure, accessible, and performant web apps. My background in cybersecurity gives
      me a security-first mindset when building interfaces.
